Search List

With this widget, you can perform search operations within the list.

When you don't want to perform search operations within the list, 
you can disable the textField by setting the [isFieldShow] value to [false]. 
You can customize the design of the TextField.

You can use the [searchEmptyWidget] variable to display a widget 
when the searched value is not found within the list. By default, 
[Center(child: Text('No Result'))] is provided for this design.
